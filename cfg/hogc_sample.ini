## if you use a camera (not a stream) you can define width and height. There is

## Detection section

# detection search human. You can use default or custom. If you use default,
# hitThreshold, winStride*, padding* … will be ignored
#detection = default

# Threshold for the distance between features and SVM classifying plane.
# Should be 0.
#hitThreshold = 0

# These parameter have tremendous implications on not only the accuracy of your
# detector, but also the speed in which your detector runs.
# In the context of object detection, a sliding window is a rectangular region
# of fixed width and height that “slides” across an image.
# At each stop of the sliding window  we extract HOG features and pass these
# features on to our Linear SVM for classification. The process of feature
# extraction and classifier decision is an expensive one.
# The smaller winStride  is, the more windows need to be evaluated.
# 0 to disable.
#winStrideX = 0
#winStrideY = 0

# The padding  parameter indicates the number of pixels in both the x and y
# direction in which the sliding window ROI is “padded” prior to HOG feature
# extraction.
# As suggested by Dalal and Triggs in their 2005 CVPR paper
# (http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/triggs/pubs/Dalal-cvpr05.pdf), Histogram of
# Oriented Gradients for Human Detection, adding a bit of padding surrounding
# the image ROI prior to HOG feature extraction and classification can actually
# increase the accuracy of your detector.
# Typical values for padding include (8, 8), (16, 16), (24, 24), and (32, 32)
# 0 to disable
#paddingX = 0
#paddingY = 0

# An image pyramid is a multi-scale representation of an image.
# At each layer of the image pyramid the image is downsized and (optionally)
# smoothed via a Gaussian filter.
# This scale  parameter controls the factor in which our image is resized at
# each layer of the image pyramid, ultimately influencing the number of levels
# in the image pyramid.
# A smaller scale  will increase the number of layers in the image pyramid and
# increase the amount of time it takes to process your image.
# For example, 1.05 resize to 5% each image.
#scale = 1.05

# Unknown parameter
#finalThreshold = 2.0

# oefficient to regulate the similarity threshold. When detected, some objects
# can be covered by many rectangles. Should be false
